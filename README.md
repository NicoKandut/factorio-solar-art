# Factorio Solar Art Generator

This is a web application that converts pictures into blueprints for huge solar farms.

You can use it here: [https://nicokandut.github.io/factorio-solar-art](https://nicokandut.github.io/factorio-solar-art)

I also set up a discord to share blueprints, talk about bugs and new features etc: [https://discord.com/invite/jPf45KS54t](https://discord.com/invite/jPf45KS54t)

# Example

# Known Issues

Help is welcome with these:

- The app cannot handle images that exceed 900x900 pixels because the resulting string for factorio would be too big.
- When the image uses transparency, some entities on the edges can be unpowered.

# Installation (optional)

The only benefit of installation is that you can use the app offline.
